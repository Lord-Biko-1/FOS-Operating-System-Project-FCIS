# FOS-Operating-System-Project-FCIS

In this project, we build the main and essential modules in Operating System based on FOS

## Project Modules
### Milestone 1

In milestone 1 we built a dynamic allocator to dynamically allocate blocks in memory using different strategies

Milestone functions<br />
1- Initialize Memblocknodes<br />
2- Find Memblock<br />
3- Insert in ALOC List<br />
4- Allocating blocks using First Fit Strategy<br />
5- Allocating blocks using Best Fit Strategy<br />
6- Allocating blocks using Next Fit Strategy<br />
7- Insert Block in Free List<br />
8- Autocomplete for the command line<br />

### Milestone 2

In Milestone 2 we built essential Paging functions, Kernal Heap functions, Chunk Operations Functions

Milestone functions
9- Allocate Chunk in RAM<br />
10- Copy Chunk from one place to another<br />
11- Cut chunk from one place to another<br />
12- Share chunk
13- Calculate the required frames for a chunk
14- Calculate allocated frames
15- Initialize the Dynamic block system
16- Allocating in Kernal Heap
17- Freeing from Kernal Heap
18- Get a Physical Address
19- Get a Virtual Address
20- Clear Page Table Entry
21- Get Page Permissions
22- Set Page Permissions
23- Virtual to Physical address


### Milestone 3

In Milestone 3 we worked on handling page faults and apply Placement Replacement strategies and apply clock algorithm, building essential user heap functions, support semaphores and sharing

Milestone functions
24- Fault handler
25- Create Semaphore
26- Signal Semaphore
27- Wait Semaphore
28- Create shared Object (Kernal and User)
29- Get Shared Object (Kernal and User)
30- Allocate Shared Object
31- Free user memory (Kernal and User)
32- Initialize user heap dynamic block system
33- Allocate in the user heap
